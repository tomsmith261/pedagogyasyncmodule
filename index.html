    <title>Sound Design - Tom Smith</title>

    <h1>Sound Design</h1>
    <p>
        One thing we hear all the time in film discussion and theory is the overwhelming importance of sound. Film as we know it is a visual medium, as well as an auditory one.
    </p>

    <p>
        You may be thinking that this hasn’t always been the case. What about the silent era? For the  first few decades of cinema, sound couldn’t have been a factor. Think back to the films of Charlie Chaplin, Buster Keaton, and so on.
    </p>
    <img src="imagefolder/chaplin1.jpg" alt="A screencapture from Charlie Chaplin's film City Lights" style="width:400px;height:300px;">

    <p>
        But with the absence of dialogue and sound effects, filmmakers of this era still relied on some  element of sound to help tell their story. And that element was primarily music. Take for  example this clip from Charlie Chaplin’s City Lights. Notice how music compliments the  visuals and helps set the tone.

    <p>
        <div>Today, now that we are well past the silent era, sound plays a much more integral part to our  experiences of films.</div><br>
        <div>And it’s not just dialogue that has been added in. In any film, we are hearing an intentional  sound design.</div><br>
        <div>The sound designer’s responsibility is not to make sure the audience hears everything, it is to  carefully select what the audience should or shouldn’t be hearing, and in doing so, reshape the  experience of the film.</div><br>
    </p>
    <h2>
        Exercise:
    </h2>
    <p>
        Take a look at this clip from Blade Runner. As you’re watching, listen very closely to the sound  design. Then in the box below, list all the different sounds in this scene that stood out to you.
    </p>
    <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Umc9ezAyJv0" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
    <p>
        List all the sounds you heard in this clip. How did these sounds change your experience of the  scene?

    <p>
        Nearly all the sounds you heard in that clip, with the exception of the dialogue, were not  captured on set during filming. The scene could have very easily just been two people talking  to each other in a silent room. <br>
        Instead, the sound design lets the audience become more immersed in this science fiction  world, a world much larger than this one room. <br>
        It’s very common for sound design to incorporate sounds that are not captured on the day of  the shoot. There are entire “libraries” of prerecorded sound effects that most Hollywood  productions share and utilize. <br>
        (Think of how you’ve probably recognized the exact same explosion sound effect in 10 different  movies, or a knife being drawn, pistol being cocked, a punch, etc.) <br>
        Although many new sound effects are created in a foley studio, by someone who’s job it is to  artificially create sounds we’re familiar with. This job is the foley artist. <br>

        Here's an example of a foley studio.

    <p>
        What about sound that is captured on set? Usually, it’s better to minimize as much sound as  possible in the shoot (other than dialogue) and let the sound designer do their work later.  Here’s some examples of how a prop master accomplishes this. <br>
        (Really just the first minute of this clip discusses sound, but I recommend the rest of the video  if you’re curious about the other cool work prop masters do) <br>

    <p>
        Consider this: If you’re shooting a film, what are some other things (props or otherwise) that  might make too much unwanted noise in your shot? Can you think of any good solutions?

        More sound effects doesn’t always mean better. Sometimes good sound design can be in  what doesn’t make a sound, but realistically would. Great sound design isn’t about copying  reality, it’s about creating the best reality for world of the film. <br>
        The film “A Quiet Place” is famous for being about people staying as silent as possible. This  has prompted many jokes online about the film being easy to sound design for. But I feel that  the sound design in this film is among the most impressive I have ever seen. <br>
        Every sound you do hear, no matter how close to complete silence, is an intentional choice on  the part of the filmmakers to increase the suspense. <br>

        What didn't you hear in this clip that you probably would have heard in real life?

        Finally, I’d like to point out that great sound design is present in media beyond filmmaking. <br>
        I’m a big fan of the podcast “Mission to Zyxx”. It is a fully improvised comedy/science-fiction  audio series. Not only is it very funny and engaging, but they put countless hours into their  sound design to create entire immersive worlds using only audio. <br>
        I strongly recommend you check the show out. Here is a link to their pilot episode (about 4  minutes long) <br>
